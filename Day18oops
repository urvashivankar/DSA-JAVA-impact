inheritance : example 
//multiple inheritance is not possible in java

class A {
    static void method1() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }

    int method2(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

class B extends A {
    int method3(int a, int b) {
        return a - b;
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        B obj = new B();

        // Calling inherited method from class A
        B.method1(); // Static method can be called using class name

        // Calling method2 from class A
        int sum = obj.method2(10, 5);
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);

        // Calling method3 from class B
        int diff = obj.method3(10, 5);
        System.out.println("Difference: " + diff);
    }
}

-->polymorphism : Polymorphism means "many forms".
In Java, it means the same method name can behave differently based on:
the object that calls it, or
the parameters passed to it.
-->real life examples:
Imagine the word draw():
A Circle draws a round shape.
A Square draws a box.
A Triangle draws a triangle.
But they all use the same method name: draw().
So, same method name â†’ different behavior depending on the object.
